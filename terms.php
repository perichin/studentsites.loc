            <p>PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO ANY DEBT OFFER OR OTHER TRANSACTION. We do not offer any products or services described on the Site. Instead, the Site acts as a venue to allow debt settlement companies, and other parties who are customers of our Site, such as marketing partners (each, a "Provider"), to offer debt relief opportunities to consumers (each, a "Prospect"; all Prospects and Providers are referred to together as the Site's "users") who have visited one of our Sites or affiliated sites and given their information to be contacted by debt relief companies (the "Service"). We are not involved in the actual transaction between any Prospect and any Provider even though we may, through our Site or other affiliate sites, and with each Prospect's authorization, collect certain information (collectively, a "Lead") about any Prospect and sell such Lead to a Provider. As a result, the outcome of any service related inquiry, including but not limited to not receiving an offer for debt help is solely the responsibility of each user and not <span class="title-span-abbr"></span>. We are an independent contractor for all purposes. Importantly, we do not provide debt relief services. We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of any Prospect or Provider. We do not endorse or recommend any Providers, or Companies offered by any Provider. We do not guarantee that any of the Providers to whom we forward any Prospect's information will contact such Prospect or agree to provide the Prospect with any form of help.

To help the government fight identity theft, the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify your identity, Providers may obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who filled out a for. For example, they may ask for your name, Social Security Number or driver's license number, address, date of birth, and other important information, that will allow proper identification of you. During the Provider application process, they may also ask for additional information. By clicking on any button indicating an acceptance or agreement to terms, a continuance of processing, a request to be contacted about debt relief or additional information or any other submission ("submission"), you understand that you are agreeing to the stated terms and conditions of that submission and that you are submitting an inquiry as to debt relief opportunities or another product or service through <span class="title-span-abbr"></span> to each of the Providers to whom your request is transmitted.

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. In the event that you believe <span class="title-span-abbr"></span> removed any of your Content in response to a false notice of copyright infringement, you should notify <span class="title-span-abbr"></span> promptly in writing pursuant to the DMCA, at the mailing address provided above. Such notification should include: (i) your physical or electronic signature; (ii) identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled; (iii) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and (iv) your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. Furthermore, you should include a clear statement of your acceptance of process pertaining to the notifying party or the agent of the party as defined in DMCA Â§ 512(c)(1)(C). If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, <span class="title-span-abbr"></span> may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole and absolute discretion. <span class="title-span-abbr"></span> has a policy of terminating the account of, or denying access or use of the Site to, in its sole and absolute discretion, any user who repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.</p>

Any claim or cause of action you may have hereunder or with respect to your use of the Sites or the Service must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action first arises.

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds any provision of these Terms, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of these Terms, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect. Except for Sections 11, 12 and 13 above, these Terms do not give rise to any third-party beneficiary rights.
